Instructions on how to startup application

Cd the project location in terminal

-> Cd COMP_2601_A4
-> Cd Chat Server Nodejs with WebSockets
-> Type "npm install"
-> Type "node app.js" ** This will get your server running 

Run the application on Xcode, using device iPhone 6, iPhone 7, iPhone 8, other sizes will not work

Click the Take Me To Chat

Connect To The Server

Type and Send Messages
** Using the enter button to send a message wonâ€™t work, you need to press the send button

** Return to the other pages

** See your conversation in the terminal and web view at the local port listed in terminal

**Enjoy

**When viewing the code open A4, and then open a4.xcworkspace and not a4.xcodeproj as the files are all in the sxworkspace because we used the pods!!!!


Here Are The following implementations that have been added to my application


Functionality Adaptations
    - UIAlert For Connection
    - UIAlert For Disconnection

Page Adaptations
    - UILaunchScreen Page Added
    - UIInstructions Page Added
    - UIExit Page Added
    - UIMainMenu Page Added

Button Adaptations
    - UIConnect Button Midified // TODO
    - UIDisconnect Button Modified // TODO
    - UISend Button Modified // TODO
    - UIChatBubbles // TODO


Here are the different tools that I used
** https://www.raywenderlich.com/143874/websockets-ios-starscream **
I found this resource to be super helpful as well as the other guides that he has to offer on his website

** https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream **
I found the documentation here very clean and organized, I found it very helpful during the building process of my application

** For Further Learning **

Would be nice if we did the 8Ball // Pool Assignment as a class, I found it very challenging even with the knowledge given in class but would love a in class demo on how to build something like this specially with the collisions, that is the part that I had the most trouble with!
