\f0\fs20 \cf2 Here are the different tools that I used\
** https://www.raywenderlich.com/143874/websockets-ios-starscream **\
I found this resource to be super helpful as well as the other guides that he has to offer on his website\
\
** https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream **\
I found the documentation here very clean and organized, I found it very helpful during the building process of my application \
\
** For Further Learning **\
\
Would be nice if we did the 8Ball // Pool Assignment as a class, I found it very challenging even with the knowledge given in class but would love a in class demo on how to build something like this specially with the collisions, that is the part that I had the most trouble with!\
